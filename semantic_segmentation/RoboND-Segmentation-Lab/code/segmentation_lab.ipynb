    "In this lab, you will build a deep learning network that locates a particular human target within an image.  The premise is that a quadcopter (simulated) is searching for a target, and then will follow the target once found.  It's not enough to simply say the target is present in the image in this case, but rather to know *where* in the image the target is, so that the copter can adjust its direction in order to follow.\n",
