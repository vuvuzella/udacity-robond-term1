# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:

1. Clone the repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project.git) 
2. Fill out the TODO's
3. Optimize your network and hyper-parameters
4. Train your network and achieve an accuracy of  40% (0.40) using the intersection over union metric
which is `final_grade_score` at the bottom of your notebook
5. Make a brief writeup report summarizing why you made the choices you did in building the network

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1155/view) Points

## Submission:

1. Your `model_training.ipynb` notebook that you have filled out
2. An HTML version of your `model_training.ipynb` notebook
3. Writeup report
4. Your model and weights file in `.h5` file format

Spend some time at the end to discuss your code, what techniques you used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how you might improve it if you were going to pursue this project further.
